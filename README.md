# Networking Essentials for Cybersecurity

---

## 📡 I. Networking Basics  
### 🌐 What is Networking?  
Networking connects devices (computers, phones, servers) to exchange data and share resources. Think of it as building a digital highway for communication.

### 🖥️ Key Networking Components  
- **Nodes**: Devices like computers and phones.  
- **Links**: Pathways (cables, Wi-Fi) that connect devices.  
- **Network Types**:  
  - **LAN**: Local Area Network (home, office).  
  - **WAN**: Wide Area Network (internet).  
  - **MAN**: Metropolitan Area Network (city-wide).

## 🌍 II. IP Addressing  
### 🏠 What is an IP Address?  
An IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network, like a postal address.

### 🏷️ Types of IP Addresses  
- **IPv4**: 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1).  
- **IPv6**: 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::7334), supports more devices and has built-in security features.  

### 🔒 Public vs. Private IPs  
- **Public IPs**: Visible on the internet, assigned by ISPs.  
- **Private IPs**: Used within local networks (e.g., 192.168.x.x), hidden from the internet via **NAT (Network Address Translation).**

## 📡 III. Key Networking Protocols and Ports  
### 📦 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)  
Ensures reliable delivery of data by establishing a connection before sending data.

#### 🔢 Common TCP Ports & Applications  
- **80**: HTTP (Web browsing)  
- **443**: HTTPS (Secure browsing)  
- **21**: FTP (File Transfer Protocol)  
- **22**: SSH (Secure remote access)  
- **25**: SMTP (Sending emails)  
- **3306**: MySQL (Database communication)  
- **3389**: RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)  

### ⚡ UDP (User Datagram Protocol)  
Faster but less reliable than TCP; does not confirm receipt of data.

#### 🔢 Common UDP Ports & Applications  
- **53**: DNS (Translates domain names to IPs)  
- **123**: NTP (Network Time Protocol)  
- **161**: SNMP (Network device monitoring)  
- **69**: TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)  
- **500**: IPsec (VPN encryption)

## 🚨 IV. Common Network Attacks  
### 🛑 1. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)  
**Attack**: Floods a network with excessive traffic, overwhelming the server.  
**Prevention**: DDoS protection services, traffic filtering, and rate-limiting.  

### 🕵️‍♂️ 2. MITM (Man-in-the-Middle)  
**Attack**: Intercepts communication between two parties to steal data.  
**Prevention**: Use HTTPS, encryption, and secure VPNs.  

### 🎭 3. ARP Spoofing  
**Attack**: Sends fake ARP messages to associate the attacker’s MAC address with another device’s IP.  
**Prevention**: Use static ARP entries and network monitoring tools.  

### 🌐 4. DNS Spoofing  
**Attack**: Manipulates DNS records to redirect users to malicious websites.  
**Prevention**: Use DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) and trusted DNS services.  

### 🎣 5. Phishing  
**Attack**: Fraudulent messages trick users into revealing sensitive information.  
**Prevention**: User education, email filtering, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## 🔐 V. Cybersecurity Best Practices  
### 🔑 1. Use Encryption  
Secure sensitive data in transit with HTTPS, IPsec, and VPNs.  

### 🛡️ 2. Apply Strong Authentication  
Use **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for critical systems.  

### 📊 3. Monitor Network Traffic  
Use **Wireshark** or network monitoring tools to detect anomalies.  

### 🔍 4. Segment Networks  
Use **VLANs or subnets** to isolate sensitive systems.  

### 🛠️ 5. Regularly Patch Devices & Software  
Apply security updates to fix vulnerabilities.  

### 🏰 6. Use Firewalls & IDS/IPS  
Deploy **firewalls** to filter traffic and **IDS/IPS** to detect and prevent malicious activities.  

### 💾 7. Backup Critical Data  
Regularly store backups securely to prevent data loss from attacks.  

### 📚 8. Educate Users  
Train employees on cybersecurity risks, phishing, and best practices.  

### 📶 9. Secure Wireless Networks  
Use **WPA3 encryption** and strong passwords to prevent unauthorized access.

## 📟 VI. Key Network Devices  
### 🛤️ 1. Router  
Connects different networks (e.g., home to the internet).  
**Security Role**: Blocks unauthorized traffic using **ACLs (Access Control Lists).**  

### 🖧 2. Switch  
Connects devices within a LAN.  
**Security Feature**: Supports VLANs for traffic isolation.  

### 🚧 3. Firewall  
Filters traffic based on security rules.  
**Types**: Packet-filtering, stateful, application-layer firewalls.  

### 📶 4. Access Points (APs)  
Provides **wireless connectivity**.  
**Security Concern**: Weak passwords or insecure configurations.  

### 🛡️ 5. IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems)  
- **IDS**: Monitors traffic and sends alerts.  
- **IPS**: Blocks malicious activity in real time.
